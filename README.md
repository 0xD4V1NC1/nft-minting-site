# Prerequisites 
1. Some programming knowledge of React, Typescript, Solidity, and hardhat smart contract development framework
2. Knowledge of how to generate your NFT images, and metadata and deploy it to the IPFS. If you don't know you can look into a Youtube tutorial or look up art-hashlip generator tutorial.

# Getting Started
1. Clone Repo
2. Run yarn install 
3. Once you have ran yarn install, install nvm and run the command `nvm use` to make sure you are using the version of node I have specified in the package.json and .nvmrc file
4. If you don't already have TSLint Plugin, install the TSLint plugin in vscode. That should work with the TS settings I have configured in the tsconfig.json file
5. Next navigate to the `/hardhat` directory and run `yarn install` again. This will install all of the dependencies needed for running hardhat our hardhat project. ALL HARDHAT COMMANDS will have to be ran from this directory. 
6. Next you will need to check out the `.env.example` file at the root directory of the project and the `.env.example` in the `/hardhat` directory and replicate those files.
7. Take a look at the `tailwind.config.js` file and customize your primary and secondary colors for your theming.
8. You should be all set. I encourage you to purge/remove all unused icons and components you do not intend on using to decrease the overall build size. The reason I have so many icons and UI components is b/c this repo is intended to be a very good starting template.

# Starting up the Project
1. First you will need to navigate to the `/hardhat` directory and run `npx hardhat clean` (this wont matter the first time but is a good habit to ensure no old contract artifacts effect your contract behavior) , `npx hardhat compile`  (this will compile all contracts in the `/hardhat/contracts` directory), `npx hardhat node` (will start the development hardhat environment on `http://127.0.0.1:8545/`) and then `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-nft.ts --network localhost`. 
2. When you are ready to deploy your contract to the mainnet or a testnet you can run `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-nft.ts --network <network name>` If the Network you wish to deploy to is not in the `hardhat.config.js` file you will need to update that variable and variables on the FE to make sure your application matches where you wish to deploy.  
3. In another terminal tab run`yarn start` will start up the FE application.
4. IMPORTANT NOTE: You should deploy your contract before starting up the Front End Application. By running the deploy script, a `.json` file using your NFT's SYMBOL as its name (ex: 0xWF.json) will be written to the /src directory of your NFT project so the FE application can read in the contract. 
5. This project has been successfully deployed and hosted on the web via Fleek.io (`pl7yg-5aaaa-aaaad-qbwiq-cai.ic.fleek.co`) but I am sure you can deploy this site via other methods if you want

# Using Hardhat Locally
- You can add hardhat to metamask and import the accounts generated by hardhat node. 
- To add the hardhat network locally click "Add Network" in metamask and use `http://127.0.0.1:8545/` as the RPC URL, `31337` as the ChainId, `Hardhat Local` as the Network Name and `GO` as the Currency City
- Next import one of the hardhat accounts that are listed when you ran `npx hardhat node` via the private key generated in the terminal. It is important TO NEVER USE THIS ACCOUNT ON THE MAINNET. All Funds sent here WILL BE LOST. Name the account something relevant to ensure you never accidentally use it. I named mine `Hardhat Account #0` since that is the primary key that I imported.

# Deployment
1. When deploying your application you will want to make sure that the application is pointed to the blockchain you are trying to use. In the `ConnectWalletModal.tsx` file you will want to make sure that connector.activate is pointed towards the chain of choice. 
In our project that will be Polygon, and the var you should see is `POLYGON_CHAIN_ID`. 
2. At the top of the same file is where you will import the `LOCALHOST_CHAIN_ID` (if trying to test locally), and `POLYGON_MUMBAI_CHAIN_ID` if you are testing on the polygon testnet... Or a different chainId that you have defined in the `consts.ts` file.

# Additional Scripts
`yarn storybook` will run the storybook UI library so you can have a playground for the components in the components/UI directory. Customize your UI components as you see fit.
